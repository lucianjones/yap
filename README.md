## Project Description

Yap is a live chat application, featuring servers and channels to allow for groups to efficiently communicate. It takes inspiration from apps such as Discord and Slack. This full stack application was created using React / Redux on the front-end, Python / Flask on the back-end, SQLAlchemy / Postgres as a database, and Socketio to connect it all together.

## Home Page
yap was designed with a one page application in mind. The user should be able to access every tool they need within the spread of the home page. A nice mellow dark theme was chosen in order to help alleviate eye strain with prolonged usage. The users servers, channels, as well as a place to search for new servers are all accesable from this main page.

## Live Chat
One of the main goals of yap is to keep the user updated, without a pause in their workflow. By utilizing Socketio, messages in the users currently selected channel are updated live, without the user having to do anything!
